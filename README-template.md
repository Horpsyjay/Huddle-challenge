### What I learned

I learned alot on working with illustrations in this project. And the magical grid display, my media query ball game improved too.

I learned about the grid order too.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.subscribe form {
  display: grid;
  gap: 2rem;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(auto, 300px) auto;
  margin-top: 1.5rem;
  margin-left: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll like to continue to improve on my grid and media query properties. then Js is in view.
